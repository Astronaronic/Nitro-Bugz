# Nitro-Bugz
A Pokémon-esque monster catching game thats purpose is to solely imitate Pokémon games. Kind of like Pokémon Essentials but without needing to buy software.

Being made in GDevelop.

Currently, you'll need to re-assign the sprites since GDevelop doesn't know which folder they're in. I'll do that later.
